  Deployment 
--------------

All of the procedures, procedures, and tasks necessary to make a software system or upgrade accessible to its intended users are referred to as software release.  

The following procedures explain the deploying mechanism followed in the project. 

 

First, we will publish the developed system to a folder by using Visual studio. 

Then we open the IIS server and create a new website called Online GroceryLK. 

Then we set the binding and ports to the website and the IP addresses. 

Then we copy the published folder to IIS server root path and set the Path location to created website in IIS server. 

Then we set the database connections to the created website application pool. 

Then we run the created website.
